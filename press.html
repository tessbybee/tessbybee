        <h3> SLUG MAGAZINE REVIEW OF EKPHRASIS </h3>
        <img class="slug" src="http://i.imgur.com/JHsgQh2.png"/>
        <p>There’s an oversaturation of folk bands in Provo, but this album is charming and off-beat enough from the typically clean-cut music of Happy  Valley to stand alone. It rubs into you nicely— like a good sweater from the D.I. Soft accordion is the threshold to intellectually stimulating lyrics that seem to unapologetically examine religion. “Earnest Blood/Rapture,” declares, “There’s a spirit in my book and it’s telling me lies / Tricked me into feeling guilty about things that naturally come from an earnest heart that’s still pumping blood.” While there are heavy lyrical moments, the overall texture of Ekphrasis is bittersweet. “Sway With Me” brings a swirling, singalong lightness, while “Organic Computer” is a tender denouement with fingerstyle guitar and a simple proclamation: “I need the truth / So I can be less confused.” –Kia McGinnis</p>
